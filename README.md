#How does apps like adobe photoshop , canva and most popular image processing apps work behind the hood to scale,rotate,filter and perform other invaluable matrix transformaions on an image;
How do these apps perform these operations on an image:
1. rotation
2. scaling the image
3. shearing the image
4. translating the iamge
5. reflectin g the image
   
##My interest in this project is sparked by the desire to explore 
1. how images are represented in the computer memory(spoiler: as a matrix  of pixels)
2. how linear algebra ; mainly the idea of matrixs makes it possible to perform transformations on an image

### The main functionalities explored in the program:
1. Loading and representing and image as a matrix
